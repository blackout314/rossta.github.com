    <p>Recently, I cobbled together an entry for the <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/">10K Apart Contest</a>. The contest encouraged participants to build an entirely front-end web application in HTML/CSS/Javascript in under 10 kb of total assets, not including some allowable third party libraries such as jQuery or Prototype. Entries must also leverage HTML5 features, some of which include local storage, the canvas API, and web workers.</p>

<p>Several entries had already been submitted by the time I heard of the contest back in mid-July. I found games, like <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/62">Lines</a>, search engines, to-do lists, and so on. I considered implementing a Flickr slideshow that would make use of the contributions I’ve made to the <a href="http://github.com/weplay/supersized">supersized</a> jQuery plugin at Weplay, but ultimately decided on a Keynote/Powerpoint alternative.</p>

<p>It’s called soapbox. The inspiration comes from <a href="http://github.com/schacon/showoff">showoff</a>, which is backed by a server. soapbox provides an in-browser interface to create, preview and present slides with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> or markup. Slides are auto-saved to local storage, if available, as json. I sent in <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/361">my 10K Apart entry</a> on the deadline day. You can also find the latest on <a href="http://github.com/rosskaff/soapbox">github</a>.</p>

    <p>Sharing team photos and video is central to <a href="http://www.weplay.com">Weplay</a> and my team has been working hard recently to make some dramatic improvements to the media gallery experience.</p>

<p>One area in dire need of attention was the ability to edit photo metadata easily: changing captions, deleting pictures, moving from one album to another, etc. A user was forced to submit changes for up to sixty photos at a time with one post request. The response was slow and the potential for losing lots of changes was unacceptable.</p>

<p>We committed to swapping this experience with a more user-friendly ajaxified set of interactions. Each change is saved as you go and the updates take place in line. A key component of our front-end javascript is use of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>‘s <code>$.delegate</code>, available as of jQuery 1.4.2, and custom events.</p>

<p>I put together a brown bag presentation for my team explaining the benefits of $.delegate and custom events, currently available at .</p>

<p>The slides are written in markdown and presented using Scott Chacon’s excellent <a href="http://github.com/schacon/showoff">showoff</a>, which allows the embedding of printed, executable javascript. Note: since showoff ships with jQuery 1.4.0, the <code>$.delegate</code> examples are not currently executable.</p>

      </h2>
        
    </header>
    <p>As Calvin was leaving the classroom, he turned back toward me with a smile and a glint in his eye. That was all I needed to see to know: the lesson had made an impression. As a teacher, nothing beats that feeling. I could sense he wanted to say something; he was looking for the right words. He then told me about a website he knew of where he wanted to try more on his own.</p>

<p>A friend at the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/09/X128/default.htm">Mott Hall III in the Bronx</a> invited me to speak at the school’s career day this past Friday. I may have been slow to respond, but as a former teacher myself, I knew this was one opportunity I could not pass up.</p>

<p>Mott Hall III is a not a typical public school school. At some 320 students in grades 6 through 8, it’s small. Students are admitted by application. There is an air of curiosity and respect that accompanies a school where students are held to high expectations.</p>

<p>I was one of about twenty speakers to speak with four groups of students for 30 minutes at a time. I wasn’t sure how to present until I learned I was offered the computer lab. I couldn’t resist: I would have students write a computer program.</p>

<p>Having left myself only a day to put something together, I decided it would be easiest for students to access a web page with a javascript console where we could walk through a few commands. Visual feedback would be key. There are some great in browser javascript consoles that came to mind: <a href="http://www.jconsole.com/">jconsole</a> comes to mind. But the console needed a visual aspect&emdash;something to manipulate and see results. As I had done for many lessons as a teacher for years, I decided to roll my own.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rosskaff.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/playground.html">Javascript Playground</a> was born. Dirt simple, but effective for a short lesson, it is intended to be a lightweight introduction to using javascript. For career day, my aim was simply to have the students dip their toes in the process. Maybe experience a setback and (hopefully) find success. They would enter middle school students and leave computer programmers.</p>

<p>I put together a Keynote presentation to introduce the lesson and help students see why software engineers and computer programmers were relevant as builders of software for familiar technology like iPhone Apps, Facebook and Twitter. A segment I called “Computers are Dumb”, (common responses: Wha’? and Huh?) was inspired by my colleague <a href="http://boxornot.com/2008/07/21/how-i-became-a-programmer/">Noah Davis</a>, who had done something similar for his own career day talk. I pretended to be a walking, listening computer who needed instructions to get around desks from one side of the room to the next. I let students shout out instructions which initially led to some comical results. “Turn right” resulted in my spinning in an endless loop and “Walk straight” usually ended with me walking into a wall or chair. The point: computers will do exactly what we tell them to do, not always what we <em>think</em> we’re telling them to do. This was important prelude to the playground.</p>

<p>We then turned our attention to the computers. Once I had led them to the playground and introduced a few commands, within minutes, they were hiding, showing, fading, and moving “Player 1″, a 50×50 pixel image of me. To keep things simple, I made <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> available and loaded the console textarea with the player one selector prefilled: <code>$(&quot;#player1&quot;)</code></p>

<p>I would demonstrate a command like</p>

<p><code>$(&quot;#player1&quot;).hide()</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>$(&quot;#player1&quot;).fadeOut()</code></p>

<p>and many students were quick to discover the complements: <code>.show()</code> and <code>.fadeIn()</code>. The real challenge for the ten minute lesson was to <em>move</em> player 1 from one corner of the screen to the “Home” area.</p>

<p>I could have used the <code>.animate()</code> function with options for manipulating <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties, but to simplify things, I wrote a more literal plugin <code>$.fn.move(x, y)</code> as a wrapper around <code>animate</code>. The <code>move</code> command simple takes x and y coordinates as paramaters&emdash;something I could tell was familiar for them from their math classes. While <code>move</code> added the x and y values to their current position, <code>$.fn.goto(x, y)</code> was introduced to jump directly to a place on (or off) the screen. It wasn’t long before the experimentation had begun. A few students figured out how to run multiple commands at once, some even used chained commands on their own: <code>$(&quot;#player1&quot;).fadeOut().fadeIn()</code>. Students were soon signaling me to show how they had led player 1 home.</p>

<p>At each of the sessions, I never seemed to leave enough time for questions. I encouraged students to return to this blog to post comments. I hope I was able to make computer programming a little more accessible and enjoyable for these motivated students in the Bronx. I may have even caught a bit of the teaching bug again myself.</p>

      </h2>
        
    </header>
    <p>On top of the list of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">best practices for speeding up your website</a> is reducing the number of HTTP requests required to render the page. As our websites grow and there are more pages to style, we have more style rules to deliver to our visitors. Keeping the number of requests to a minimum usually means we either need to put all our styles in a single stylesheet, or use a bundling strategy such as <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">Jammit</a> or <a href="http://github.com/brynary/asset-trip">Asset Trip</a>, like we use at <a href="http://www.weplay.com">Weplay</a>, to pull our stylesheets together as one at deploy time.</p>

<p>One problem with the single CSS request approach is we often send CSS rules that our users don’t need to render the page initially or at any time during the current page view. This is like making dinner for 10 when only 2 people have RSVP’d; it can potentially be a big waste. In this wacky ajaxy world we live in, who says all your CSS needs to be on the page at load time? Consider using just-in-time CSS for page elements that aren’t necessary to display right away.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a lightbox to display gallery images that is only rendered when a user clicks on a page link. The CSS rules needed to render the box shouldn’t have to be loaded during the initial request. We can pull these out into a separate stylesheet and load it on demand with javascript.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Demo</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello World
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function require(url) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// logic to determine url is for a css file here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var element = document.createElement(&ldquo;link&rdquo;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;element.setAttribute(&ldquo;rel&rdquo;, &ldquo;stylesheet&rdquo;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;element.setAttribute(&ldquo;type&rdquo;, &ldquo;text/css&rdquo;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;element.setAttribute(&ldquo;href&rdquo;, url);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementsByTagName(&ldquo;head&rdquo;)[0].appendChild(element);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The code example defines a function ‘require’ that builds a stylesheet link tag and inserts it into the head of the document. The function is triggered as a callback from the onload event of the document body with a url to the ‘app.css’ file located in the same directory. Alternatively, we could attach the function call to a different event, such as click on a link to a popup that might need the styles.</p>

<p>The key is that the HTTP request is not made until the stylesheet tag is appended to the document head tag after the page has already loaded. We decrease the number and/or size of the requests needed to render the page initially keeping our visitors satisfied.</p>

    <p>At some point we learned to walk, yet most of us find ourselves taking first steps time and again. Moving to another city. Going to a new school. Choosing a different career.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, I have done all these things: I moved to New York from Houston, started a Computer Science degree at NYU, and switched to a career in Software Engineering from Education. Starting anew has been at times difficult, occasionally impossible. It hasn’t always been fun and I’ve made my share of mistakes. And now I’m looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned.</p>
