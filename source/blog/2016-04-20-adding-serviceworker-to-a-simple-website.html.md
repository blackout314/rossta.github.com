Sorry, [progressive enhancement is not dead](http://tomdale.net/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-dead/). Given the excitement around the introduction of Service Workers to modern browsers, perhaps the perspective on progressive enhancement is shifting. We are seeing a rebirth of interest in using JavaScript to layer on user-experience improvements without ignoring "the rest".

Service Worker is well-suited to enhance a simple website like this blog. The Service Worker API has been designed in such as a way that developers can pick and choose the features they want without completing reworking their sites or committing to a (or another) JavaScript framework.
