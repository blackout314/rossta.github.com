Today, I made a brown bag case to my colleagues: letâ€™s approach client-side development in a more structured, disciplined and flexible way; in other words, add a model-view-controller javascript layer to our web app. Included is some background for the discussion and a brief introduction to Backbone.js. I use the phrase MV+ to embrace various implementations of MVC-like javascript frameworks, most of which have different takes on what object take on the responsibility for hooking up models and views.
