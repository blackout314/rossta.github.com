Why build an app in Hanami?
* Coming from Rails
* What the app is

Hanami opinions are not Rails opinions
* Convention over configuration
* Different conventions!
  - layout
  - architecture
  - code reloading
* [Monolith first](http://hanamirb.org/guides/architectures/container/)

Hanami MVC is not Rails MVC
* Controllers, Views, Templates
* Repositories and Entities instead of ActiveRecord
* No associations or scopes

The Project is still young
* Pining for missing features
* Assets
* Associations

The Community is still young
* Authentication
* Pagination
* Errors - view tests, sucker punch
* Community [chat](https://gitter.im/hanami/chat) and

Reasons for choosing Hanami
* Lightweight
* Architecture
* Thread-safe

Hanami is and is not Rails
