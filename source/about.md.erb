I have been creating and maintaining web applications for over ten years. I recently completed the Computer Science master’s degree program at New York University while working full-time. I am now the Head of Engineering at [ChallengePost][chal], the public challenge platform where I am leading the team building the leading challenge and hackthon platform while improving our development and deployment practices.

I previously worked at [Weplay][wepl], an online youth sports team platform and social community. Before its acquisition by TeamSnap in 2013, Weplay grew to over 400,000 users on 25,000 teams across the country. We built messaging, scheduling, recurring events, drill library, local sports news, activity distrubution, and group privacy controls. Some other notable features included team map visualization, media uploading and gallery, league management tools, color customization, user signup validation, inline-editing interfaces, team polling, and avataring.

I’ve played large roles in defining the product vision, providing customer support, evangelizing best practices for Javascript coding and testing, and improving front-end performance.

I previously taught science in Houston, TX at Jackson Middle School in the [Houston Independent School District](hisd) and at the amazing [YES College Prep](yesp). At YES, I coached a robotics club that twice won the state [Botball](ball) championships.
