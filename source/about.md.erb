# Stop coding in circles</h1>

Working all day and struggling through coding challenges, tutorials, and your side projects at night?

Are you making the transition from another career into web development?

I know, I've been there.

I didn't grow up coding like a lot of my colleagues. Like you, I discovered the joy of programming later in life. I know how challenging it can be to learn this completely new way of thinking while dealing with LIFE.

But hey, you've got it good - there were no coding bootcamps or StackOverflows when I was starting out. If I could do it then, you can definitely do it now. Even better, you can learn from my mistakes.

I previously worked at [Weplay][wepl], an online youth sports team platform and social community. Before its acquisition by TeamSnap in 2013, Weplay grew to over 400,000 users on 25,000 teams across the country. We built messaging, scheduling, recurring events, drill library, local sports news, activity distrubution, and group privacy controls. Some other notable features included team map visualization, media uploading and gallery, league management tools, color customization, user signup validation, inline-editing interfaces, team polling, and avataring.

I’ve played large roles in defining the product vision, providing customer support, evangelizing best practices for Javascript coding and testing, and improving front-end performance.
